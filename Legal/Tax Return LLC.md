# Tax Return LLC

#### Can my foreign company be the owner of a US LLC or Corporation?

If you form a LLC, yes. Instead of appointing an individual as a “managing member” you can appoint your own foreign company. If you chose to form a corporation, at the time of registration we only appoint “Directors” and they have to be individuals. Please note that Directors does not own a corporation. A corporation is owned by its shareholders, and from this point of view, your foreign company can own 100% of any US corporation.https://www.activefilings.com/incorporation-services/international-plan/faqs/

#### Do I need an EIN for my business?

Your EIN, or more technically your Federal Tax Identification Number, consists of nine digits issued by the IRS. The IRS requires an EIN for any business that has employees or is taxed as a C corporation, partnership or LLC. You’ll also need an EIN if you file employment taxes, excise taxes, or alcohol, tobacco, or firearm tax returns.

#### Single-Member LLC

You must treat your single-member LLC as a disregarded entity for tax purposes unless you elect to treat it as a corporation. That means if you are a nonresident alien individual, you report the business or rental activity of the LLC on Form [1040NR (*U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return)*](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040nr.pdf). There is only a single level of taxation.

You are not required to file Form 1040NR if your LLC owns only personal use property that does not generate revenue. However, whether or not you have a Form 1040NR filing requirement, under special reporting requirements beginning in 2017, you are required to file [Form 5472 with a pro-forma Form 1120](https://form1040nr.com/u-s-tax-primer-for-nonresident-aliens-with-single-member-llc/#5472). This requirement is explained in detail below.

#### LLCs With More That One Owner

If you own your LLC together with one or more partners, the LLC is classified as a partnership for tax purposes by default. U.S. tax law treats a partnership as as an entity separate from its partners, but it is a pass-through entity and it generally does not pay tax at the partnership level.

You must file [Form 1065 (*U.S. Return of Partnership Income*)](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1065.pdf) to report the income and expenses of the partnership, then report your share of partnership income and expenses on your Form 1040NR.

#### Corporate Election

Alternatively, you and your partners can elect to treat the LLC as a corporation for tax purposes. Then you would file a corporate return on Form 1120 rather than a partnership return, and the LLC would pay tax at the corporate level.

#### What is a Dependent Agent

Let’s explain the “dependent agent” requirement with two examples.

**Example 1: Foreign software company without US office or representative**
A Mexican software company is performing programming/design work for US clients. It is based in Mexico and has no US office or sales agents. All sales are done over the phone or online.

The company can open an LLC to receive payments in USD in a US bank account. The work is performed in Mexico and the owners are non-US citizens/residents, who are not taxed in US. Therefore, the LLC income is not taxed in the US as there are no offices or dependent agents in the US.

**Example 2: Foreign “Fulfillment by Amazon” service provider**
A foreign entrepreneur sells products into the US market using Amazon’s “Fulfillment by Amazon” service.  All marketing and procurement are managed online by the non-US citizen, who lives in Colombia. Products are ordered and shipped to Amazon’s warehouses, where Amazon employees package the products and ship to customers in the US.

In this case, Amazon is not a dependent agent but an independent agent that has its own business with millions of other clients. Amazon is not uniquely working for this foreign entrepreneur.

Even though Amazon is not a dependent agent, the Amazon seller may still engage in a US trade or business. If the seller doesn’t manufacture the product, then the actual transaction, the transfer of ownership, takes place in the US. This means the seller may have to pay US income tax.

Again, the tax code and courts have been vague if this qualifies as ETOB. To mitigate the risk, setting up a C corporation would be a safer approach.

#### US LLC tax filing requirements for foreigners

Previously single-member LLCs with foreign owners were not required to file. However, starting 2017, all foreigners who own a US LLC must file a 5472 US tax return with the IRS for disclosure purposes even if they do not owe tax in the US.

In addition, foreign owners should be aware of the LLC tax implications in their local fiscal residence jurisdictions. The income from the US LLC may still be taxed in the country of residence.

#### Who must file IRS Form 5472

In short, if your US company has a foreign owner or foreign shareholders then the company probably has to file form 5472 with the IRS. Back in December 2017, the US tax reform expanded the filing requirements and significantly increased the penalties for not filing or filing incorrectly. Therefore it’s important to understand who must file Form 5472 and how to do it.

Form 5472 is an Information Return that a 25% foreign-owned US Corporation or a Foreign Corporation Engaged in a US Trade or Business must file. For foreign-owned US LLCs, this [filing requirement](https://onlinetaxman.com/major-new-us-tax-reporting-requirement-for-foreign-owned-llcs/) started in 2017.

### When a foreign-owned US corporation must file Form 5472

Foreign-owned LLCs and C corps with at least 25% foreign shareholders or partners must file the information return Form 5472 for every year with reportable transactions. (More about reportable transactions below.)

The corporation, not the individual owner or shareholder, files this form. Any penalties would be assessed to the US corporation.

The form 5472 due date is April 15, together with your company’s Form 1120. If you file an extension for your corporate tax return, the Form 5472 is due together with the tax return on October 15.

A single-member foreign-owned LLC is a Disregarded Entity for tax purposes, meaning that all income flows through to the owner. For the purpose of Form 5472 however, the LLC must file Form 5472 together with a pro-forma Form 1120 (usually used for corporations) by the due dates listed above.

Although the LLC is considered a flow-through entity for US tax purposes, other countries may consider it a default corporation. Some countries may tax owners/shareholders when the money they withdraw from the LLC in the form of a dividend, salary or profit distribution.  We work with trusted partners in many countries to help interpret these rules locally as well.

#### Penalties for not filing Form 5472

The new tax law substantially increased the penalties for not filing or filing something deemed substantially incomplete from $10,000 to $25,000 per year per form. The penalty also applies for failure to maintain the required records.

This is a major incentive to file and to do it correctly.

What if you haven’t file the form in past when you should have? Or suspect that you may have made mistakes when submitting, maybe inadvertently omitted something you didn’t know needed to be included? We can help you correct or catch up with your filings. As licensed CPAs we can represent clients in case of IRS pushback on these issues.

#### Reportable transactions for Form 5472

The foreign-owned company must list all reportable transactions on form 5472. Now, what are reportable transactions?

The [IRS defines](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i5472.pdf) a “Reportable Transaction” very broadly. Basically, it includes any type of activity between a foreign owner and the US corporation, with no limit in value.

**Examples of reportable transactions:**
-   The exchange of money or property, including payments, rental income, sales transactions, remuneration, commission payments, capital contributions and capital reductions
-   The use of US company property, such as real estate, by a foreign owner or related party
-   Loans and/or interest payments between the corporation and a foreign owner

To put this in layman’s terms, if you receive money from the LLC into your personal account, contribute money to the LLC (capital contributions), pay for an expense on behalf of the LLC (such as the franchise tax or registered agent fees) or have any transactions involving the LLC, you need to file 5472.

As mentioned earlier, the 2017 tax reform expanded the reporting requirements for foreign-owned US disregarded entities, basically foreign-owned US LLCs. Now you must also report any amounts paid or received in connection with the formation, dissolution, acquisition and disposition of the LLC including contributions to and distributions from the LLC (Part V of the form). Furthermore, for this form you need to calculate the asset value at the end of the year.

#### How to file Form 5472

An LLC owned by a non-US person must first obtain an US Employer Identification Number (EIN) to complete Form 5472.  Unfortunately, you cannot e-file Form 5472. You must submit it by paper or fax.

The [instructions for the form](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i5472.pdf) are rather complex and difficult to understand, even for native English speakers familiar with the US tax system. We help hundreds of foreign companies with their US tax filings every year. Our team speaks Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Swedish, Norwegian, Serbian, Bulgarian, Russian, and German.
