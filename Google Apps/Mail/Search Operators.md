# How to use boolean AND and NOT operators in Gmail search

Use the minus sign to make a negative rule. You can also string rules together by just leaving a space between separate rules.

For example:

```
from:name@company.com -from:name2@company.com
```

or you can do things like

```
is:unread -in:spam -in:trash
```
